# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS (for Ubuntu)
# (You could try running this as a script, even)
# A list of everything I had to do to get the ground station so far working


sudo apt-get update

#If you want to use the entire system, start from here:
sudo apt-get install rtl-sdr           # Control sdr stick & demodulate signal

#If you want to test the decoder but don't care about demodulation,
# start from here:
sudo apt-get install direwolf          # Decode APRS

#If you don't want to test decoding OR demodulation,
# and just want to run the server, start here:

sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential # Install pip to get fancy python libs.

#Install python package dependencies

sudo pip install --upgrade pip
pip install autobahn[twisted]          # For WebSockets.

# Chromium browser is optional; There's an "app" mode in it that you might want to use
#  if you want the application to look more like a native app rather than a webpage.
sudo apt-get install chromium-browser
