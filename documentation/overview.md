# Ground Station System Documentation

This ground station software was developed as a proof-of-concept and an exploration of the possibilites
for an SDR-based ground station.  As such, the implementation is a bit messy.  Hopefully this
document can explain more-or-less what all the components are and how they connect.

## 1. Overview

The UVic Rocketry Ground Station is used to display live telemetry data (transmitted by
an off-the-shelf "BigRedBee" board) during a rocket's flight, allowing us to find the rocket
(or its wreckage) after it lands, as well as identifying parachute deployment and other stages
in the rocket's flight.  The software supports location tracking on a map, live data logging, and
live visualization of altitude and vertical velocity.  Offline use is also supported.

During operation, telemetry data transmitted from a BigRedBee board using the APRS protocol is
received by a software defined radio.  The data is demodulated and decoded by open-source software
`rtl_fm` and `direwolf`.  The output from these programs is then read by a python server, which
both records the data and makes it available to a client-side webapp via a web socket.

The client webapp receives frames of telemetry data from the server and uses this information to
display the rocket on an OpenLayers map, which can be made to work offline.  Altitude data is
also plotted over time (using the Flot library), along with vertical acceleration data which
is useful for determining the flight state of the rocket.

## 2. Hardware

Besides a computer to run the ground station software, three main hardware componnets are necessary:
the transmitter on the rocket, the software defined radio (SDR) stick, and a suitable antenna.

The transmitter on the rocket is a commercial off-the-shelf tracking unit sold by 
[BigRedBee](http://www.bigredbee.com/), with a suitable antenna, battery, and the like.  
This obviously needs to be placed somewhere that isn't blocked by materials that are opaque to radio
transmissions - for example, it can't be placed in a carbon fibre tube.

The receiver on the ground station should be a Software Defined Radio (SDR) stick similar to the
Realtek RTL2838 (which we use).  [Here](http://www.rtlsdr.com/2012/04/rtlsdr-compatibility-list/) 
is a list of possibly compatible hardware.  This is essentially a little USB dongle, originally
designed for receiving digital TV, that can also receive a variety of radio frequencies.

The SDR stick should be attached to an antenna.  Most will come with a small antenna that works fine
at short-to-medium ranges.  We haven't tested it in flight, instead using an antenna from a handheld
BaoFeng radio, but other solutions may also work.  Hopefully someone with more electrical knowledge can
expand on this section of the documentation in the future.

A final note: although this software can be run on pretty much any computer, environmental conditions
at some launch events (e.g. extreme heat at the Spaceport America Cup) might have adverse effects on
regular laptops, so it could be worth designing custom ground station hardware.  UVic Rocketry's ground 
station consists of a Wandboard Quad board housed in a Pelican case, and worked fine in desert conditions.

## 3. Decoding and Demodulation

The signal received from the BigRedBee board is transmitted once per second (or at another rate, depending
on configuration) using the APRS amateur radio protocol.  This needs to be received, demodulated, and
decoded by the ground station. The system uses [rtl\_fm](http://kmkeen.com/rtl-demod-guide/), part of the 
rtl-sdr project, to demodulate the signal.  The output from `rtl_fm`, which is essentiall raw audio data, is
piped into [direwolf](https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf), which decodes the APRS packets into a
string containing latitude and longitude (in "degrees, decimal minutes" format), as well as altitude and
a descriptive string.  The exact format and content of the data received from the BigRedBee depends on how
the board is configured.  More information about this may be added to this documentation in the future.

## 4. Server

The python server (`server/wsserver.py`) starts the demodulator and the decoder (by running the script
at `server/decoder/testingtools/decode.sh` as a subprocess), parses the decoded data
(using `brbparser.py`), and sends it to a client over a web socket, 
while logging the data received to a JSON(ish) file 
and printing it to the screen.  However, the exact behaviour depends on the state of the `config.json`
file in that directory.

### Configuration Options

- **doTestFromFile**: If `true`, then rather than starting the demodulator and decoder to receive a live
radio signal via the SDR, the system will simply test the server & client using data points from a 
`data.json` file in the `server` directory.  The following three settings (`doRepeat`, `doInitialPause`,
and `playbackSpeed`) only have an effect if `doTestFromFile` is set to `true`.
  + **doRepeat**: If `true`, continuously loop the data from `json.data`; if `false`, only play the data 
once.
  + **doInitialPause**: If `true`, the server will wait for 10 seconds after starting up before reading and
sharing the data from `json.data`.  If `false`, the server will start immediately after startup.  This
option is available to make testing with the server and client together easier.
  + **playbackSpeed**: The number (or fraction) of seconds to wait between reading/processing each data
point in `data.json`.  Contrary to what the name suggests, a larger number results in a lower playback
speed.  Sorry.
- **haveSDR**: Used to indicate whether you currently have the SDR hardware (SDR stick and antenna)
plugged in to the computer.  It `true`, the server will attempt to receive data live via radio (i.e.
will actual perform its intended purpose as a ground station).  If false,
prerecorded test data (found in `server/decoder/fakertl_fm`) will be used instead, fully testing the
server and direwolf, but not `rtl_fm`, and not actually receiving any signal via radio.
- **doLogData**: If `true`, all data points recorded (as well as potential error messages) will be recorded
in `log.json` (new data points will be appended to the file if it already exists).  If `false`, data will
not be logged.
- **doWebSocket**: If `true`, the server will be able to accept a web socket connection from a client and
send data points over the connection as they are received.  If `false`, this will not happen (only logging,
if enabled, and output in the console will occur).
- **frequency**: The radio frequency to monitor.  Should be a string, with "M" signifying megahertz (i.e.
enter the freuency 433.00 MHz as "433.00M").
- **callsign**: The callsign that the Big Red Bee is transmitting under.  Only has an effect if 
`filterCallsign` is enabled.
- **filterCallsign**: If `true`, any data packets originating from a callsign other than that specified
in the `callsign` attribute will be ignored.

### Server Behaviour

Upon running `wsserver.py`, the server will begin reading data from a data source (either live radio
data, or one of two types of test data depending on the `doTestFromFile` and `haveSDR` settings). As
each data point is encountered, it is parsed (using `brbparser.py`) into latitude, longitude, and 
altitude data, and is given a time stamp.  

After being parsed, each data point is appended to `log.json` (unless logging is disabled).  Each
data point is stored as a JSON object, with fields "timestamp", "altitude","longitude","latitude",
"raw" (i.e. the raw data, prior to parsing), "timestring", and "error" (true or false).  The
data points are appended to the file separated by commas, but if you want to make the file into
a true JSON file, you'll need to add an opening `[` at the beginning, and replace the trailing
comma with a closing `]`.

While running, if the seb socket functionality is enabled, the server can accept a web socket 
connection from a client (only a single client at a time has been tested).  This connection
will use localhost port 9000.  If the client 
disconnects, it can reconnect without the server restarting.  After each data point is parsed, the
JSON data is sent over the websocket to the client.

Each data point is also printed to stdout when parsed.


## 5. Client

The client application `client/index.html` is an HTML/JavaScript application that runs in a 
web browser (tested in Chromium and Firefox).  To run the client, open `client/index.html` in
the browser of your choice.  Upon page load, the client will attempt to connect to the server
via a websocket.  If the server is not yet running, you'll need to start the server and then
reload the client.  Restarting the server will also require reloading the client.

The client has two main features: a map, and a display including plots of altitude and vertical
velocity of the rocket over time.

The map uses the [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) library, and can connect to a 
WMS service to use as a base map  If
connected to the internet, it will use [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) data. Other 
services can be configured in the file `client/config/configWMS.js`.

Every time a new data point is received from the server via the websocket connection, the location
of the rocket on the map (represented by a triangular icon) will be updated, and the rocket's new 
location will be added to the red trail representing the rocket's path so far.  Clicking on the magnifying
glass icon will cause the map to automatically pan and zoom to the rocket's current position.

The altitude display uses the [Flot](http://www.flotcharts.org/) library. 
Every time a new data point is received from the server, it is added to the collection of data
displayed in the altitude and velocity plots.  The altitude is readjusted to measure above
ground level, where "ground level" is the altitude of the first data point received.
Vertical velocity is calculated from the altitude data.

The current altitude of the rocket should always display above the altitude chart.

## 6. Offline Mapping

The client can be configured to use a WMS service as a base map.  If an internet connection will not be
available at launch, an offline base map can be provided by running a WMS service locally.  We did
this using [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/), an open-source Java server for GIS data.  Unfortunately, 
a description of how to obtain data for your launch site and set up a WMS service using 
GeoServer is probably beyond the scope of this documentation.
